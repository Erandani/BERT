# BERT

BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) is a pre-trained transformer-based neural network model developed by Google for natural language processing (NLP) tasks, such as text classification. BERT is trained on a large corpus of text data and is able to understand the context of a given sentence by considering the words that come before and after it.


BERT can be fine-tuned for text classification by adding a classification layer on top of its pre-trained layers and training the model with labeled data. The fine-tuned BERT model can then be used to predict the category or label for new, unseen text data. BERT has been proven to be very effective for text classification tasks and has set new state-of-the-art performance on several benchmarks.
